        WHAT IS YOUR APPROACH FOR AUTOMATION?
        -I read the acceptance criteria carefully.
        -I then create my test cases
        -Then I do my manual testing FIRST
         -If all good, then I start complete my automation script
         -If I find a bug/defect, then I talk to dev. Dev fixes the issue, then I retest.
         If all is good then complete my automation script
        -When teh automation is complete, I prepare the report for teh user story. In fact, My automation script
        generates html reports for us. I upload those reports to the JIRA.
        -For my manual test cases, I manually take screenshots and prepare reports and attach them to the JIRA.
--------------------------------------
        WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR AUTOMATION TEST CASE PASS?
        -Prepare report and upload to JIRA
---------------------------------------
        WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR TEST CASE FAIL?
        -Retest to make sure from the failure. It can be data issue, typo, documentation issue or is can be a real bug.
        -If that is a bug, then talk to the dev and let them fix the bug.
        -After the fix, we retest. when test cases passes we upload to jira
----------------------------------------------
        WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU FIND A BUG?
